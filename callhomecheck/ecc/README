- Use -V to show eccagent welcome message, it exits 0.
- Modify log4j configuration file to modify how eccagent generate log.

- To use eccagent arguments:
		 * S = ECC Service type. e.g. ProblemReport, patching, etc. Currently the default service is ProblemReport
		 * E = ECC HOME; libs for ecc client, e.g. c:\\ecchome\\eccRootDirectory 
		 * i = Component ID (IBM/*********); For test SYM = IBM/5725G8601; LSF = IBM/5725G8201
		 * v = Version (611, 71, 711, 911, 912, 913, etc.)
		 * I = Customer Number (Customer ICN); ICN must be an existed one and should match country code.
		 * u = UUID (UUID for the cluster instance, can use a pseduo one, e.g."1234567890")
		 * N = Customer Name; e.g. "John Smith"
		 * F = IDENTIFIER, GROUP_NAME or PRODUCT_CID. For test environment, use GROUP; SYM = "IBM/SPECTRUM_SYM" LSF = "IBM/SPECTRUM_LSF"
		 * p = Customer phone number; e.g. "9053161550"
		 * e = Customer email; e.g. "erikwang@ca.ibm.com"
		 * s = Severity; 1,2,3,4
		 * C = Country; For test only use "US" since it needs coordinate to customer record
		 * c = CITY; e.g. "New York"
		 * T = PMR Comment Line (title); e.g. "Symphony 7.1.1 {ACE} libraries"
		 * t = PMR Start line; e.g. "This is a test PMR, please ignore"
		 * U = A gzip file to be uploaded; e.g. "/scratch/supsym/erikwang/symclnt-lnx26-lib23-x64-6.1.1_build241698.tar.gz"
		 * r = PMR URI for append additional files to the PMR. The URI is generated when the PMR is created. Don't use if it is a new PMR creation
		 * d = debug flag; default = false
		 * V = Show hello message, will not create any PMR. ecc agent will ignore all other arguments
		 * D = TESTMODE, won't call ecc API to create PMR
		 * P = Set Product ID (7 digits). This is required for backend process which migrate PMR to Salesforce case. This Parameter doesn't work with this commit. Need more info from ECC team
		 * f = Add a "[CH] " in PMR title to indentify it is a Call Home PMR, default = true
		 * 
		 * 
		 * Test example
		 * On Windows
		 * -E "C:\ecchome\\eccRootDirectory" 
		 * -i "IBM/5725G8601" 
		 * -v "711" 
		 * -I "0992394" 
		 * -u "1234567890" 
		 * -N "Erik Wang" 
		 * -F "IBM/SPECTRUM_COMPUTING" 
		 * -p "9053161550" 
		 * -s "3" 
		 * -C "CA" 
		 * -c "Markham" 
		 * -T "Call Home test PMR - From Windows server" 
		 * -t "This is a test PMR, submitted from a IDE environment on Winodws host" 
		 * -U "c:\\log.log" 
		 * -e "erikwang@ca.ibm.com"
		 * -r "https://esupport.ibm.com:443/eccedge/gateway/services/projects/ecc/iepd/services/ProblemReport?vSessionId=UNQ2016071520221819817" Note: Don't use it if it is a new PMR creation
		 * -d "true"
		 * -V ""
		 * -D "true"
		 * -S "ProblemReport" //Note: by default it is ProblemReport
		 * -P "5725Y38"
		 * 
	  
ECC agent exits with different code for different issues during PMR
creation and file upload.

//Duplicated PMR
ECC code = 7301 ==> exit as 100

//Insufficient authority for the credentials Entity ID [XXX].  It does
not match any of the ids in the Acl list. Subsequent transaction
[attach] is not allowed.
ECC code = 1120 ==> exit as 101

//Existed file name in ecurep for this PMR.
ECC code = 4454 ==> exit as 102

////RETAIN Customer Record NOT FOUND for Customer: [xxxx] and RETAIN CountryCode: [XX].
ECC code = 0552 ==> exit as 103

//RThe field: [customer number] in object: [Subject] contains invalid value: []
ECC code = 1020 ==> exit as 104

//Invalid object : [Subject]. Reason:[Required version field is missing]
ECC code = 1022 ==> exit as 105

//Other ECC related issues
Exit as 200

//ECC agent internal
97 = Demo mode is on
98 = Caller brings an unknown agrument
99 = General problem

Entitlement check
If entitlement check is enabled, customer's geographic location code (country code and city) MUST be valid and match his ICN number when call eccagent to create a PMR.
For NA Software account, use IEE as entitlement check server. See IEPD configuration
To test a not-entitled ICN 2437589 and Country = US

How customer find Call Home PMR?
User can't see Call Home automatically generated PMR on e-support portal even use the same email address. However, they can find the PMR on e-support by searching the PMR number.

- Have fun.
